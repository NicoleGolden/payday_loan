# Map: Payday Loan Legal Status in the US 

## Data source
* [Market Snapshot: Consumer use of State payday loan extended payment plans](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_market-snapshot-payday-loan-extended-payment-plan_report_2022-04.pdf)
* Analyzing the legal status of payday loans in each state requires a thorough review of their respective legislative clauses pertaining to such financial transactions.

## About this project 
* This project entails the depiction of the legal status of payday loans across the United States, individually assessed for the years 2006 and 2020, thereby providing a comprehensive comparative analysis.

## Methodology
* Payday lending regulations are classified into three categories, primarily determined by the annual percentage rate (APR). States where there are no restrictions on the APR fall under the "legal" category. Conversely, states imposing an APR cap of approximately 45% are designated as "effective ban" states, as such a limit makes it unsustainable for lenders to operate profitably. Finally, states explicitly prohibiting payday loans are categorized as "prohibited" states.
